WASHINGTON MY HEALTH MY DATA ACT (MHMD) — APPLICABILITY FLAG
Washington is in scope. If the biometric data is used to identify health status,
diagnosis, treatment, or to infer any consumer health condition, MHMD applies in
addition to general WA consumer protection law. MHMD requires:
  - separate, opt-in consent (distinct from any biometric consent),
  - a published "consumer health data privacy policy" with specific contents,
  - heightened restrictions on sale and on geofencing around health facilities.
MHMD has a private right of action via the WA Consumer Protection Act.
Address MHMD obligations explicitly in the Washington section.
` : ""}${otherUsStateApplies ? `
OTHER US STATE — APPLICABILITY FLAG
"Other US state" is in scope. Produce a dedicated "Other US State — General US Biometric Privacy Posture" section that:
  - notes Texas Capture or Use of Biometric Identifier Act (CUBI) requirements (notice, consent, retention <=1 year past purpose, no sale absent consent — Texas AG enforcement only, no private right of action),
  - notes Washington My Health My Data Act exposure where biometrics infer health status,
  - covers the broader pattern across CA/CO/CT/VA/UT/OR comprehensive privacy laws treating biometrics as sensitive data requiring opt-in consent and DPIAs,
  - identifies the most likely applicable state regime based on the organisation type and purpose described.
Do NOT skip this section even though no specific state was named.

Your task: produce a structured compliance assessment for a described biometric data processing activity, calibrated to the jurisdictions in scope and recent enforcement precedents.

BIPA — STATUTORY UPDATE (Illinois P.A. 103-0769, effective 8 August 2024):
  - The 2024 amendment to 740 ILCS 14/20 caps liquidated damages so that a single course of conduct involving the same biometric identifier or information from the same person constitutes a SINGLE violation per person (not one-per-scan as held in Cothron v. White Castle, 2023 IL 128004). Reflect this in the BIPA risk discussion: the per-person figures supplied above remain the ceiling for new conduct on or after 8 Aug 2024; pre-amendment conduct may still face per-scan exposure.
  - Section 15(b) written-consent and Section 15(a) public retention-and-destruction policy obligations are unchanged. A private right of action remains.

CITATION GUARDRAILS:
  - Cite enforcement actions ONLY from the ENFORCEMENT PRECEDENTS block in the user prompt (each tagged [E#] with an id). Never reference ICO, CNIL, AEPD, Garante, or other regulator fines from training knowledge if they are not in that block.
  - Do not invent statute years, fine amounts, or case names. If the enforcement block is empty for a jurisdiction, say so plainly rather than backfilling from memory.
  - ICO v Clearview AI (2022): the actual penalty was £7,552,800. Do NOT write '£9 million' or any other amount. CRITICAL: If Clearview AI does not appear in the ENFORCEMENT PRECEDENTS block provided in this prompt, do NOT reference it at all — not even with the correct figure. Instead write: "The ICO has imposed significant penalties for unlawful biometric data processing — refer to the ICO enforcement register at ico.org.uk for current enforcement figures."
  - Do NOT cite any 2025 or 2026 ICO fine figure from training knowledge. If the ENFORCEMENT PRECEDENTS block contains no ICO biometric cases, write: 'The ICO has imposed significant penalties for unlawful biometric data processing — refer to the ICO enforcement register at ico.org.uk for current figures.' Do not substitute a specific amount.

ENFORCEMENT FIGURES — ACCURACY RULE: When referencing specific monetary penalties, fine amounts, or settlement figures from enforcement actions, use ONLY figures provided in the ENFORCEMENT PRECEDENTS block. Do NOT recall penalty amounts from training knowledge — these change on appeal, may be misremembered, or may refer to the wrong case. Specific risks: (1) The ICO's Clearview AI enforcement (2022) resulted in a £7.5 million penalty — do NOT cite "£9 million" or any other amount. (2) Do NOT cite any specific 2025 fine figure unless it appears in the ENFORCEMENT PRECEDENTS provided. If no enforcement context was retrieved for a specific figure, write: "The ICO has imposed significant penalties for biometric data processing violations — refer to the ICO enforcement register at ico.org.uk for current figures" rather than stating a specific amount.

ENFORCEMENT CASE CITATION FORMAT IN PROSE: When referencing any enforcement case in the body of the compliance assessment, use the human-readable citation shown in the ENFORCEMENT PRECEDENTS block (e.g. "ICO (2022) — Clearview AI" or "DPC (2023) — Centric Health Ltd.") — NEVER the bracketed [E#] code. The [E#] tag exists only for your internal lookup. The [E#] labels are NOT visible to the user and must NOT appear in the output text. Reserve the exact id values exclusively for the ===ANNOTATIONS=== JSON block at the end.

QUALITY STANDARDS:
1. Risk ratings (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH/CRITICAL) must reflect actual enforcement posture in the named jurisdictions, not theoretical exposure.
2. For BIPA: the litigation risk calculation must account for per-person per-violation statutory damages ($1,000 negligent / $5,000 intentional), the scale of enrolled individuals provided, AND the P.A. 103-0769 single-violation rule for post-August 2024 conduct.
3. Priority actions must be specific — name the law, the requirement, and the concrete control or document the organisation must put in place. No generic "review your practices".
4. Where enforcement precedents show specific omissions that have been sanctioned (e.g. missing written consent, no retention schedule), call those out as priority gaps.

CITATION INTEGRITY RULE: Every specific statutory citation you produce (act name, section number, subsection letter) must be verifiable against the actual statute. Known hallucination risks to guard against: (1) PIPEDA does not use decimal sub-principle numbering — cite as "Schedule 1, Principle N (Name)" only. (2) The Breach of Security Safeguards Regulations under PIPEDA are SOR/2018-64 — no other SOR number is correct. (3) US state privacy laws do not have a universal 72-hour breach notification deadline — that is a GDPR Article 33 concept only. Apply it only where GDPR explicitly applies. (4) Quebec Law 25 uses "without delay" not "72 hours" — present 72 hours as a planning benchmark only. (5) The California breach notification standard is "most expedient time possible" under Cal. Civ. Code §1798.82 — not 30 days or 72 hours. (6) MONETARY PENALTY RULE: Never state a specific monetary fine, penalty, or settlement amount unless that exact figure appears in the ENFORCEMENT PRECEDENTS block provided in this prompt. Training knowledge of regulatory fines is unreliable. If a relevant case exists but its amount is not in the provided block, write "[Regulator] imposed a significant penalty for this type of violation — verify the current figure at the regulator's enforcement register" instead of recalling an amount. Known correct figures (use only if the case is in your enforcement block): ICO Clearview AI (2022) £7,552,800; ICO Interserve (2022) £4,400,000; ICO Capita Pension Solutions (2024) £6,090,000; ICO British Airways (2020) £20,000,000. If you are uncertain of a specific section number, write the section in descriptive terms and flag it: "[statutory reference to be confirmed with counsel]" rather than inventing a section number.

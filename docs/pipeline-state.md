# Pipeline Coordination Ledger

**Purpose:** Single source of truth for parallel pipeline controllers (this session, scheduled ticks, human dispatchers). Read this file from a fresh clone BEFORE dispatching, green-lighting, or deploying. A green-light contradicting an ACTIVE HOLD must name the hold and state why it is released.

**Stamp doctrine:** Re-read the sandbox clock (`date -u`) immediately before writing any timestamp — including this ledger's "Last updated" field and any function BUILD_STAMP. Never carry a stamp forward from an earlier turn.

**Last updated:** 2026-07-24T12:53:21Z — turn `SAMPLES-CONTRACT-lia (5/8)`

---

## 1. Active Holds

_None at this time._

Historical release: `ADMT-FIX-W9` released with wave-10 spec amendments and shipped as `run-admt-checker` build stamped `w9-admt-preemit` (real deploy ~11:49Z; the in-code `@…T12:30:00Z` marker is future-dated — restamp at admt's next deploy per stamp-doctrine correction).

## 2. Queue Order (as currently dispatched)

1. **DONE PRIOR TURN** — `RECOVERY-BATCH-FIXES / TURN A` (cppa-cyber A1 + A2) — deployed 12:25Z.
2. **DONE PRIOR TURN** — `RECOVERY-BATCH-FIXES / TURN B` (cppa-risk B1a field-provenance + B1b claims guard) — deployed 12:39Z.
3. **DONE PRIOR TURN** — `SAMPLES-CONTRACT-dpia` (4/8) — frontend/test only, no deploy.
4. **DONE THIS TURN** — `SAMPLES-CONTRACT-lia` (5/8) — frontend/test only, no deploy.
5. **NEXT** — `SAMPLES-CONTRACT-governance` (6/8). Frontend-only; not deploy-locked.
6. Then — `-ir_playbook` → `-biometric` → `-dpa` (7/8, 8/8, then 9/8-out-of-8 dpa closes the series — note: series is 8 tools, dpa is #8).
7. After 8/8 — `REGISTRATION-INTAKE-CONTRACT-RAIL-MAP` (pre-approved authoring turn per overnight standing order: shared contract + rail-map + corpus-cited rails + dummy data).
8. Deferred — orchestrator → `delivery_contracts` wiring (queued between waves, see §6 sentinel gap).
9. Deferred — W9 admt build restamp (bundled with next admt deploy).

_Note:_ `CPPA-CYBER-FIX-CN-PLACEHOLDER` is **SUPERSEDED** — identical scope shipped as TURN A. Do not re-queue.

## 3. Deploy Locks

**Standing rule:** Deploying any edge function requires:
- (a) No in-flight customer-path generation on that function — query the relevant product table for rows created in the last 15 minutes with a NULL report/document payload.
- (b) No `quality_batch_runs` row in `running` or `pending` status that dispatches the function.

If either check returns a row, the deploy WAITS until the run reaches a terminal state (`complete`, `error`, `cancelled`).

**Current lock state (2026-07-24T12:53:21Z):**
- All functions **unlocked**. No deploys this turn (frontend/test files only).
- Wave 11 (~13:15Z) will re-lock risk/cyber/admt when it launches.

## 4. Last Completed Turn

- **Turn:** `SAMPLES-CONTRACT-lia` (5/8)
- **Real-time:** 2026-07-24T12:53:21Z (sandbox `date -u`)
- **Scope (frontend/test only, no edge deploy):**
  - Reconciled `F_LIA_UK` in `src/lib/sampleFixtures.ts` against `liAssessmentStageBContract`. `F_LIA_UK_SUPP` inherits the reconciliation via `withSupplemental`'s deep-clone.
  - Removed unknown top-level keys `status`, `sector`, `preview_signal`; sector text preserved verbatim inline in `processing_description` so showcase quality is retained.
  - Normalised `data_categories` to `LI_DATA_CATEGORIES` enum values (`"Location data"`, `"Health or medical data"`, `"Employment data"`) with the "beacon-proximity zone" descriptor folded into an `"Other: …"` element as the contract expressly permits (see contract comment L48-51).
  - Normalised `relationship_type` from `"Employee (existing employment relationship)"` to the enum literal `"Employee"`; the "existing employment relationship" gloss remains in `processing_description`.
  - Split `balancing_details.reasonable_expectation` (was a full sentence) into enum literal `"Partly"` + narrative moved to new `reasonable_expectation_detail`.
  - Split `balancing_details.potential_harm` (was a full sentence) into enum literal `"Severe"` + narrative moved to new `potential_harm_detail`.
  - Added required-always `preview_assessment_id: "sample-preview-lia-uk-000"`; changed `stage` from `"final"` → `"submitted"` per contract semantics (line 114 of the contract expects `"submitted"`).
  - Renamed `purpose_details.purpose_text` → `interest_statement` (the actual contract slot); `balancing_details.balancing_text` → `additional_context`.
- **Tests (green):** `_tests/contract-surface-audit.test.ts` — 3 pass / 0 fail. `li_assessment:uk` and `li_assessment:uk-supplemental` no longer appear in ADVISORY drift; ADVISORY count dropped 10 → 8. Remaining advisory drift is confined to still-queued tools (`governance`, `ir_playbook`, `biometric`).
- **Deploy:** none this turn (no edge-function or backend code changed).

## 5. Sample-Report Register

| Product | Assessment ID | Status | Report | Updated |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| cppa-risk | `fa5b36e2-20a9-485a-ba08-a66c59bd186f` | complete | ✅ | 2026-07-24 11:52:20Z |

**Recovery batches (terminal):**
- `5e0558f3` — launched ~12:01Z; **COMPLETE at 2026-07-24T12:16:46Z**. Deploy locks released. Wave-10 lost reads reclaimed. Instrument `gc-2026-07-24-s3-eu-uk-ca-au-sg`. Results:
  - **cppa-risk** run 123 (quality_run `c0d7fd2a`) — overall **84.55** / GPT 89, checks 69/75.
  - **cppa-cyber** run 104 (quality_run `be400771`) — overall **83.60** / GPT 86, checks 50/60.

### Batch 5e0558f3 digest (CPPA recovery reads)

- **cppa-cyber HIGH — citation** (doc `fdf1f109`): malformed unresolved placeholder `"11 CCR § 7123(c)(N)"` appears verbatim in Authentication, Audit-log management, and Segmentation remediation — template variable not substituted in `run-cppa-cybersecurity` output path. **FIXED by TURN A deploy 12:25Z; verify at wave 11 re-measure.**
- **cppa-cyber HIGH — hallucination** (doc `54602516`): exec summary asserts "mean score of 81 across all 18 scored components" not verifiable from visible output; also miscounts controls "Implemented or Mature". **FIXED by TURN A deploy 12:25Z; verify at wave 11 re-measure.**
- **cppa-cyber MEDIUM ×2** (doc `fdf1f109`): near-identical boilerplate remediation across 16/18 controls; actionability lacks cohort deadlines (e.g. April 1, 2028 >$100M cohort), artefact specificity, and owners.
- **cppa-risk HIGH — hallucination** (doc `fcbcc203`): `inconsistency_flags` attributes `q5b_profiling_observation` value to `sensitive_location_basis` (actual intake: "Not applicable — no sensitive-location processing") — intake field cross-attribution. **FIXED by TURN B deploy 12:39Z; verify at wave 11 re-measure.**
- **cppa-risk HIGH — hallucination** (doc `1b32c6a9`): risk register states "profiling/inference generation confirmed" derived from `i1_processing_purpose` which does not state it — overclaiming from intake. **FIXED by TURN B deploy 12:39Z; verify at wave 11 re-measure.**
- **Note on counts:** `quality_findings` rows log ALL check results; `severity` = check tier, `passed` = outcome. The 6 critical-tier rows on cppa-risk are `passed=true` (qc_r1_1, qc_r1_4 PASSED on all 3 docs). Failure counts: cppa-risk **2 high**; cppa-cyber **2 high + 2 medium**.

## 6. Carry-Forward Registers

- **Sample-Report Register** — see §5.
- **REGEN-NEEDED (samples-contract):** `cppa_risk` (1/8), `cppa_admt` (2/8), `cppa_cyber` (3/8), `dpia` (4/8), `li_assessment` (5/8). Regen click deferred to end-of-program walk-through (admin-UI click — queued for morning per overnight standing order §1).
- **Build-stamp restamp deferral:**
  - W6 scrubbers (admt/risk) — held until after wave 8 completes (T2-S3-VERIFY-1). Wave 10 landed; may be considered after wave 11 measurement.
  - W6 cyber — SUPERSEDED this turn by `w10-cyber-a1a2` (fresh-clock stamp).
  - W9 admt (`w9-admt-preemit` marker future-dated) — restamp at admt's next deploy (no solo redeploy).
- **L5 backlog:** 85 aggregate rows, 0 unclassified. Standard cron continues.
- **Sentinel gap:** orchestrator runs not yet registered as `delivery_contracts` (DS-T2 sweep would not catch orchestrator isolate death). Wiring queued between waves.

## 7. Incident Log

### 2026-07-24 — Split-Brain Green-Light on ADMT-FIX-W9
- **Timeline:** Digest-analysis controller placed ADMT-FIX-W9 on HOLD (plan-only, pending diagnosis). A sibling controller filed and independently green-lit the fix on its own gate. Deploy of `run-admt-checker` landed ~11:49Z coincident with in-flight customer generation `8f6b316d` (invoked 11:47Z).
- **Outcome (fortunate):** All three in-flight sample generations reached `complete` with valid reports. No isolate death observed on the customer path.
- **Root cause:** Controllers shared no readable state; HOLD was not durable outside its originator's session. Sibling turn also skipped the re-read-sandbox-clock-before-stamping practice — third occurrence — producing a future-dated `@…T12:30:00Z` build marker.
- **Remediation:** This ledger. Standing header rule (read before dispatch). Deploy Locks §3 include the in-flight customer-run check, not batches only. Stamp doctrine reasserted in header and applied to §4 timestamps.

### 2026-07-24 — Wave-10 Orchestrator Stall (batch `2ec63cd3`)
- Isolate died 11:15:27Z after `cppa-risk` termination; `dpia`+`admt` completed independently; `cppa-cyber` never dispatched.
- **Reconciliation status: COMPLETE.** Row reads `status=cancelled`, `phase=done`, `completed_at=11:52:01Z`, `last_error` populated. `cancel_requested=true` preserved as a historical marker. No action outstanding.
- Recovery batch `5e0558f3` (see §5) now underway to reclaim the lost cppa-risk and cppa-cyber reads.
- DS-T2 sentinel would **not** have caught this (orchestrator runs not yet contracts).

### 2026-07-24 — Stale-Clone Queue Insertion (BATCH-5e0558f3-EXTRACT)
- **Timeline:** A tick controller drafted a queue insert from clone `e724d19` (12:07Z) and inserted `CPPA-CYBER-FIX-CN-PLACEHOLDER` as the next item. The insert was unaware that `RECOVERY-BATCH-FIXES / TURN A` — already green-lit and shipping the same placeholder fix plus deterministic aggregates — was deployed at 12:25Z. TURN B (`cppa-risk` field cross-wiring) was briefly demoted behind the duplicate item.
- **Outcome:** Duplicate work item removed; TURN B restored as NEXT within the same tick (~5 minutes). No code deployed or execution started for the duplicate.
- **Root cause:** Controller read the ledger at tick start and did not re-clone before dispatching an insert, while another parallel turn completed its work and updated the ledger in between.
- **Remediation:** Reinforces the standing header rule: **re-clone immediately before dispatch, not at tick start.** All controllers must read `docs/pipeline-state.md` from a fresh clone before acting.
